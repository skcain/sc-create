ROAR
I was approached to create a website for an upcoming New Orleans band, ROAR! I started with a couple brainstorming sessions to learn what the band mates wanted for a visual brand and overall content of the site. ROAR had an online presence and the website presented an opportunity to unite the brand on a single page. I created wireframes and design mock-ups to align us on a single direction. 


Once we aligned on the vision, I began building the site before the band went on tour. A simple version of the site launched in October 2015, and I continue managing new feature development on a rolling basis.
