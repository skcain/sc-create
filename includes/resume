Resume

Summary
I am passionate about working with civic technology because I believe in the power and impact that government services can provide to community members. 

I help improve systems by learning from the people who are using them and exploring ways to expand upon their knowledge and improve their experience. My expertise in visual design and information architecture allow me to produce user-focused material. First and foremost, my greatest strength is my ability to learn and listen.
