SPR Posters

OSMRE was working to protect streams near mining operations, and needed new visual designs to raise awareness of key issues. The graphics team was asked to create seven posters that would be used as educational tools during public meetings for the Stream Protection Rule. 

I managed development for three of the posters: Protection of Hydrologic Balance, Revegetation, Soil and Fish and Wildlife Protection and Coal Regions. I worked with a policy expert in each area who ensured that the design accurately represented the new regulations. 

I started by interviewing and learning from the experts and asking them to sketch their ideas. I refined the sketches, gathered more feedback and began building in Illustrator. I worked closely with members of OSRMEâ€™s graphics team to ensure a cohesive brand across the different designs. We would occasionally swap files to improve details. After managing several rounds of approval, the designs were ready for print.
