Personal Portfolio

I am in the process of redesigning my portfolio and will update this section as I progress. 

Research & Brainstorming
As I re-design my portfolio, I’d like to create something that tells a story about who I am as a designer and individual. 

The beginning of my design process always begins with research. In this instance, it involved self-reflection on who I am and what I’ve accomplished. A UX designer lead me in an exercise called Branding Deck so that I could build a semantic word list of my personal brand. I used Pinterest, Niice and Google Images to look for visual representations of the words and began to organize them into a map.

This helped me narrow my focus and develop a message that I would share throughout my portfolio. 

Outline
I looked at the work I’ve completed and began to curate based on how it supported my personal brand and story. I decided to develop content for each piece and compiled an outline to create a cohesive flow from one project to the next.

I don’t envision that every prospective client or employer will read through every piece in its entirety. By writing a description of each project in detail, I will improve my personal brand communication in general and reflect on what I’ve accomplished.

Content Creation
Now I am in the process of generating content for each project.
