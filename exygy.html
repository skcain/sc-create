    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>In the early 1800's Spanish artist Francisco De Goya, created a chalk drawing of an older bearded man, struggling to walk with a cane in each hand. In the top right corner, written in cursive is the phrase, <i>"Aun Aprendo,"</i> which translates to <i>"I am still learning."</i></p>
    <p>The phrase "Aun Aprendo" is a great description of my process and the work it takes to create user-centered design.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy making things for my friends and family (drawings, hand-sewn items, hand-bound books), reading, and improving my boxing skills.</p>

        </a>
        <p>The workforce system encompasses various local, state and federal resources such as unemployment, job centers and WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act), a federally funded program to grant money for job training.  The system is complex and difficult to navigate resulting in job seekers who drop off when they become unsure of their next steps. Job seekers were more successful when they connected with someone who could help guide them to a career. If more candidates understood clear expectations ahead of time, attrition rates would be reduced and overall job center engagement would improve.</p>
        <p>The information available online for the various job centers in New Orleans was sparse and spread across websites. If someone had a question or was unsure what to do, they had to visit a center. Once they arrived they would be prompted to complete steps that they could’ve done on their own time, such as sign up for LAWorks, the Louisiana state job website.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We heard from various career counselors that another drop off occurred when job seekers expected to walk in and out the same day with a job. When this didn’t happen, they lost valuable trust in the system and did not return.</p>
        <p>After a small print test, we built a mobile-first website that compiled information about each job center in one place. It provided suggestions to make the most of a visit, such as in advance and remembering to bring a driver’s license or state ID. A job seeker could also take a career assessment that matched their interests to potential careers in New Orleans. Throughout the website, messaging indicated that the process would take time but that the job seeker would be supported throughout.</p>

        <p>If career counselors can spend more time connecting job seekers to services that will lead them to careers, there will be better participation in the workforce system.

        <p>A partner on our project, Skillful, a Markle Initiative, was developing a platform to promote skills-based hiring. They found that employers were increasingly writing job postings that included education requirements higher than necessary. For instance, although the current workforce in a given position might on average have a high school diploma, an employer might ask for a Bachelor’s degree or higher. This practice eliminates a large portion of skilled and quality workers from applying. Furthermore, hiring overqualified workers can lead to turnover, lower quality work and a lack of growth opportunities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User research and interviews with workforce professionals and employers</li>
          <li>Moderated design sprints and collaborative design sessions</li>
          <li>Designed and developed UI</li>
          <li>Prototyped solutions with InVision and tested with users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the beginning of our fellowship, we were asked to research implicit bias in job postings and develop ways that it might be identified and removed. In addition to education bias, we learned that reading level might also deter a qualified person from applying. For example, if a job requires a high school diploma but is written at a college level or higher, it may not be approachable to someone who is capable of completing the work. Furthermore, the average adult reading level in the U.S. is 7th/8th grade. Finally, we researched gender bias and how the language used in a job posting can attract more male or female candidates, perpetuating a lack of diversity in the workplace.</p>
        <p>A couple days after being placed on the New Orleans team, our team began our first sprint to develop Posting Pro. The initial iteration was built upon two open-source libraries. The first flagged words based on three categories of implicit bias, and the second determined the equivalent grade reading level for a block of text. The tool would serve to identify areas of implicit bias within a job posting.</p>

          <div class="clearfix"></div>
        </div><p>Over the next couple months we continued to refine and test the tool with hiring managers and HR representatives in New Orleans and San Francisco. Although we found that Posting Pro added value and promoted diversity, we needed to better understand the hiring process so that we could integrate the tool without adding extra work.</p>
        <p>Halfway through the year we worked to add a “Start from Template” feature to Posting Pro. This would allow an employer to create a job posting from one that already existed for a given position. The templates were written without implicit bias and explicitly referenced skills required for the position rather than using education as a proxy. As the hiring manager edited the posting, it would be analyzed for implicit bias.</p>
        <p>We determined that by helping an employer to create a job posting faster, we could integrate the tool into hiring process and create skills-based and inclusive job postings. We are still developing Posting Pro, you can check it out now by visiting <a href="https://posting-pro.herokuapp.com/" title="Posting Pro" target="_blank">posting-pro.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3em;">Web Request Update System</h2>

    <p>A web update reporting system that was easy to use and improved communication between content manager and web developers.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>User research to identify problems with current system</li>
      <li>Mapped out entire journey of a web request</li>
      <li>Developed an MVP of system using SharePoint</li>
      <li>Conducted usability tests and made improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="expander">
      <div class="expander-content expander-hidden">
        <p>The OSMRE web team was struggling both to track the work we were doing and to share the responsibility of updating all the sites. As a regulatory agency, it is important that OSMRE keeps information on public-facing websites current so as to be in compliance with Surface Mining Coal and Reclamation Act (SMCRA).</p>
        <p>Each region had a different method of receiving web update requests and there wasn’t visibility into the process. Fellow employees who were requesting updates were frustrated because correspondence was inconsistent and deadlines were easily missed.</p>
        <p>I designed and created a universal system for all of OSMRE that would allow someone to submit a web update request for any site and have it automatically routed to the correct person on the web team. Any time a request was updated, the requester or developer would be notified with an email. In addition, we were able to collect better data about the average time and number of requests completed so that we could continue to improve the process.</p>

        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p>I started by interviewing people who frequently submitted web requests to better understand what was and wasn’t working. I focused on improving the system through a few key areas that came up frequently in those conversations.</p>
        <p>The existing system had workflows that emailed the requester when something changed. However, the workflows were not functioning every time and a requester had to remember to check a website to know whether or not they needed to take action. This caused some requests to be delayed in their completion.</p>
        <p>When a new web request was submitted, correspondence between the developer and requester happened through a variety of channels. This made it difficult for both to track the requirements and information about the request.</p>
        <p>Requesters often felt frustrated if a task took longer than they expected. Web developers also felt frustrated when they weren’t given enough time to complete a request. Both parties needed more visibility into the other’s workflow.</p>

        <h4>Sketching</h4>
        <p>After gathering initial research, I sketched out a full journey map of a web request and asked for feedback from both potential requesters and members of the web team. After a couple iterations, I felt confident in the process and begin building a new prototype.</p>

        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p>Many of the employees were accustomed to using SharePoint to submit web requests, so I chose to build upon what was already being used. Throughout the build process, I asked for feedback from key users who frequented the system. I observed them interacting with the system so that I was able to identify barriers in the design. I presented at staff meetings, teaching how to use the tool and recruiting additional feedback.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the tool was comprehensive enough to be used as the first version of a universal web request submission system. I taught the remaining web developers how to maintain the new system before I left to join Code for America as a 2016 fellow.</p>
