    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Need to build a presence online where I can share recent work.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Create a mobile-first website that highlights three recent projects that I’ve worked on.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>Throughout this process I asked various co-workers and fellow designers about their experiences building portfolios and sharing them with potential employers. I also shared the content and designs with various people so that I could develop a more seamless journey throughout the site.</p>

    <h4>Research and Brainstorming</h4>
    <p>I wanted to create an online platform that told a story about who I am as a designer and individual.</p>
    <p>The beginning of my design process always begins with research. In this instance, it involved self-reflection on who I am and what I’ve accomplished. A UX designer lead me in an exercise called Branding Deck so that I could build a semantic word list of my personal brand. I used Pinterest, Niice and Google Images to look for visual representations of the words and began to organize them into a map.</p>
    <p>This helped me narrow my focus and develop a message that I would share throughout my portfolio.</p>

    <h4>Content Creation and Messaging</h4>
    <p>I looked at the work I’ve completed and began to curate based on how it supported my personal brand and story. I decided to develop content for each piece and compiled an outline to create a cohesive flow from one project to the next.</p>
    <p>Next I identified potential visitors and their motivation so that I could create a journey through the site. By writing a description of each project in detail, I improved my personal brand communication in general and reflected on what I’ve accomplished. However, not every visitor will dedicate the time to read through all of the content, and I wanted to ensure that everyone was able to quickly grasp main concepts.</p>
    <p>I began writing about a few key pieces of work and asking for feedback from close friends and family. For each project, I identified the main problem, solution, process, and skills and tools used. In the future, I’d like to be able to create custom portfolios where I can quickly pull together pieces that highlight different skills. As I build the content into a website, I will custom-tag each piece so that I can easily sort them later.</p>
    <p>I am still working on editing the content describing my work.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>After I had a draft of the content, I began sketching ideas for the design. I wanted to start with a mobile-first approach so that I could easily show the portfolio on my phone.</p>
    <p>After pencil drawing and wire-framing, I created the design in Illustrator. I started with a simple aesthetic so that I could prioritize the message and function of the site. As I developed the content and asked for feedback, I could easily remove parts of the design that did not support those priorities.</p>
    <p>I am still working on editing the content describing my work.</p>
